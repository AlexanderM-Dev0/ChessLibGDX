# Goals

A Chess Board in Java using LibGDX

  While the project isn't finished yet, the game board is fully playable. Once the ability to undo a move using the 'Z' key and the new font is added through the FreeType Library, the project could be considered completed. Despite this, there are some other Quality of Life things that I wouold like to add such as showing legal and illegal moves.

  I've wanted to program a chess board for a while now, but I wanted to make it with as minimal overhead as I possibly could using the java library "LibGDX".

# Currently Implemented
  Moveable Pieces
  
  Taking Pieces

  Undoing moves(Press 'Z')

  Reset the entire board(Press 'R')
  
  Castling (Techinically)

  Actual Chess Pieces
